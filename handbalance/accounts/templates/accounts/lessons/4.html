                                    Standing on the hands, we begin to lower our knees slowly to the stomach,
                                    back should be straight, legs are lowered below 90 degrees. Then we knock
                                    legs back into a straight handstand. Slowly and in a controlled manner. It
                                    is very important to follow the line of the body. This exercise is quite
                                    difficult and tests your readiness to learn more complex variations.
                                    It's very is important not to break in the back and not to lean forward in the
                                    shoulders as shown in the photo.

                                    Standing on the hands with the wall or partner, spread legs slightly wider
                                    than the shoulders and then bring your legs together. At the first stages,
                                    you need to do it slowly, observing the correct technique, your fullness.
                                    In this variation, only the legs should move, our shoulder should be static.
                                    This exercise develops the stabilizer muscles well. BUT if you complete this
                                    exercise you will notice how much your balance will improve.

                                    Here the technique is similar to the one you performed against the wall
                                    (with a partner). The main thing is not to afraid, because we have learned
                                    how to fall in the previous lessons. As you can see, my legs are moving,
                                    while the body is static.

                                    Here you need a good skill of feeling the body, if you have not learned the
                                    previous exercises, do them one more time. When you done them with
                                    confidence, then you can move on to this complication.

                    In this lesson, I advise you to overcome your fear of doing handstand complications.
                    Also ask your partner for help or do with the wall.
                    But it's better to ask someone to correct you. After training, it is advisable to do a
                    small stretch on the legs and shoulders.
                    This will help you feel more comfortable the next day. See you at the next training session!
