                                    Before you start learning handstand without help, first you need to learn
                                    how to fall right. To do it, if you feel that you are losing balance,
                                    rearrange the hand as shown in the video. If you move your hand to the side,
                                    your body will change position itself, and you will get down to your feet.
                                    It is also important to enter the handstand correctly.
                                    In this fragment I am demonstrating the main mistakes.

                                    This movement is basic! It will take a lot of time and effort to study it.
                                    So lets start! The initial position of the hand in front of you, one leg
                                    placed slightly forward, then you need to wave your back leg, gradually
                                    bringing the second leg. For the beginning, I recommend using the simplified
                                    version.
                                    Just bend over-down and wave your leg and then also bring the other leg into
                                    a straight handstand. Try both and pick the easiest one for you.
                                    After you have entered the handstand, some of the most popular mistakes are
                                    the sinking of the shoulders and the relaxation of the abs as shown in
                                    the video.

                    Be sure to film yourself to see mistakes. I would also advise you to try as many times
                    as possible. The more time you spend, the better result you will get.
                    To fix the mistakes that you have, return to the previous lessons, and fix these
                    shortcomings near the wall.
