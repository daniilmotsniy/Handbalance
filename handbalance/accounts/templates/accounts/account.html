                                        The video where I stand shows how it should and should not be done.
                                        HOW TO DO?
                                        Stretch your feet and knees by straining your quadriceps so you can feel your legs more easily.
                                        Straining your glutes is your center of gravity in handstand.
                                        slightly retract the abdomen and squeeze the chest inward.
                                        Pull your shoulders up as we did in the second exercise.
                                        THE BODY SHOULD REMIND A Smooth LINE.
                                        HOW NOT TO DO IT SHOWN ON THE VIDEO AS WELL.

                            The theory is finished Lets practice now
                            We approach the wall lifting one leg then the other
                            Here we find ourselves in a obsidedown position
                            We take a couple of steps this time with our hands
                            Approaching as close as possible with your hands to the wall
                            Now we form a straight line as we did in the previous exercise.
                            We tighten the buttocks
                            slightly retract the stomach and squeeze the chest
                            Pull soulders up
                            The position of the elbows is shown here, they should be as straight as possible.
                            No need to bend them like in the video
                            To get off, we lower one leg to the side and then the other
                            So BANG and we are on our feet
                            At this stage, I advise you to shoot yourself on the camera to see mistakes.

                                        Next step. Handstand with the wall
                                        The video where I stand shows how it should and should not be done.
                                        HOW TO DO?
                                        Stretch your feet and knees by straining your quadriceps so you can feel your legs more easily.
                                        Straining your glutes is your center of gravity in handstand.
                                        slightly retract the abdomen and squeeze the chest inward.
                                        Pull your shoulders up as we did in the second exercise.
                                        THE BODY SHOULD REMIND A Smooth LINE.
                                        HOW NOT TO DO IT SHOWN ON THE VIDEO AS WELL.

                        The theory is finished Lets practice now
                        We approach the wall lifting one leg then the other
                        Here we find ourselves in a obsidedown position
                        We take a couple of steps this time with our hands
                        Approaching as close as possible with your hands to the wall
                        Now we form a straight line as we did in the previous exercise.
                        We tighten the buttocks
                        slightly retract the stomach and squeeze the chest
                        Pull soulders up
                        The position of the elbows is shown here, they should be as straight as possible.
                        No need to bend them like in the video
                        To get off, we lower one leg to the side and then the other
                        So BANG and we are on our feet
                        At this stage, I advise you to shoot yourself on the camera to see mistakes.
