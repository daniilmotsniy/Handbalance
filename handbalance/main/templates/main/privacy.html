                    period, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the purposes for
                    which we process it, and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means.<br>We also
                    consider the periods for which we might need to retain personal data in order to meet our legal
                    obligations, or to deal with complaints and queries, and to protect our legal rights in the

                    data that we use, and if we can anonymise your personal data so that it can no longer be
                    associated with you or identify you, in which case we may use that information without further
                    notice to you.<br>Security of your personal data

                    This information could include internet browsing behaviour, demographic data or interest-based

                    <br>Two types of cookies are used: “Session Cookies”, and cookies that are saved permanently
                    on your computer. The first type of cookie commonly used is “Session Cookies”. During the time

                    as not to confuse you with other visitors. A “Session Cookie” is never stored permanently on

                    delete or remove personal information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process
                    it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal information where you
                    have exercised your right to object to processing (see e. below).<br>Object to processing of
                    your personal information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third
                    party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object
                    to processing on this ground. You also have the right to object where we are processing your
                    personal information for direct marketing purposes.<br>Object to automated decision-making
                    including profiling, that is not to be subject of any automated decision-making by us using
                    your personal information or profiling of you.<br>Request the restriction of processing of your
                    personal information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of personal
                    information about you, for example, if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for
                    processing it.<br>Request transfer of your personal information in an electronic and structured
                    form to you or to another party (commonly known as a right to “data portability”). This
                    enables you to take your data from us in an electronically useable format and to be able to
                    transfer your data to another party in an electronically useable format.<br>Withdraw consent.
                    In the limited circumstances where you may have provided your consent to the collection,
                    processing and transfer of your personal information for a specific purpose, you have the right
                    to withdraw your consent for that specific processing at any time. Once we have received
                    notification that you have withdrawn your consent, we will no longer process your information
                    for the purpose or purposes to which you originally agreed, unless we have another proper and
                    legitimate basis for doing so.<br>If you want to exercise any of these rights, then please
                    contact our DPO by email at info@andriibondarenko.com. Alternatively, if you are an Australian
                    resident you can also contact our Privacy Compliance Officer at the same email address:
                    info@andriibondarenko.com.<br>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal information
                    (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your
                    request for access is clearly completely unfounded or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse
                    to comply with the request in such circumstances.<br>We may need to request specific
                    information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access the
                    information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure
                    that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.<br>Changes
